subtitle: I don't know. I guess I have a lot of things to ponder.

My name is Josh Howes and I have [the sexiest job of the 21st century](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century).  I'm passionate about seeing machine learning and data science applied at scale to solve real problems. I'm a lover of math and software engineering and am constantly learning.

Outside of that, I'm a serial hobbyist who enjoys:
- playing guitar and other assorted musical instruments
- an on-again, off-again relationship with running & cycling
- woodworking
- novels of all types
- brewing kombucha
- crossword puzzles
- fishing
- and likely 3 other miscellaneous interests at any given time
